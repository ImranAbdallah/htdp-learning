# HtDP Learning Journey

My personal repository for working through "How to Design Programs" (HtDP) by Felleisen, Findler, Flatt, and Krishnamurthi.

## 📚 Repository Structure

## ⚠️ GitHub Display Note

**Some Racket files may show "Raw" or "Blame" view instead of code preview.**

This happens when files contain **image-generating functions** like:
- `circle`, `rectangle`, `ellipse`
- `overlay`, `above`, `beside`
- `empty-scene`, `place-image`
- Any function from Racket's `2htdp/image` library

### Files Affected:
- Most files in `concepts/` folders (image experiments)
- Any file creating graphics or animations

### Files That Display Normally:
- Files in `examples/` (basic syntax practice)
- Files in `exercises/` (text-based problems)
- Theory-focused code

## 🛠️ How to View These Files

1. **Click "Raw"** to view the plain text
2. **Download and open in DrRacket** (recommended)
3. **View locally** where all code works perfectly

## 📖 Learning Resources

## 💡 Note
This is my personal learning repository. The code here represents my journey through HtDP as a self-taught programmer.
