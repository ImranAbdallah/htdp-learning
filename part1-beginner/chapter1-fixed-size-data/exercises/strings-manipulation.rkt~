;; this is an intro into strings. "" double quotes are used to enclose a text in any sequence to make them a string.
"hello world"
; also dr racket can do arithmetic on strings such as
(string-append "hello" "world")
(string-append "hello " "world")
; in order to see the phrase "hello world" its essential to add a space between the two words and include " " between the words: "hello" " " "world"
(string-append "hello" " " "world")
; to check the string length its simple as
(string-length "hello world")
; you can even have fun with strings and add them with a number to get a sum total
(+ (string-length "hello world") 15)
; to change a number into a string
(number->string 25)
; to change a string into a number its the reverse
(string->number "25")
; if you try to use string->number with a string thats not a number wrapped withing string quotes what happens? you get a #false.
(string->number "hello world")
; boolean: not a number nor is it a string. booleans are either #true or #false
(and #true #true)
(and #true #false)
(or #true #false)
(or #false #false)
(not #false)
; nested arithmetic with all the data we have learned so far
(and (or (= (string-length "hello world")
            (string->number "11"))
         (string=? "hello world" "good morning"))
     (>= (+ (string-length "hello world") 60) 80))
